# Pneumonia Image Analysis

#### Context
Pneumonia is a possibly life-threatening respiratory infection for vulnerable populations like children, the elderly and people with weak immune systems. Pneumonia is the worldâ€™s leading
cause of death among children under the age of five accounting for 16% of all deaths of children under five, which was approximately 2,400 child deaths a day in 2015. The early and accurate
diagnosis of this infection is vital for effective treatment, however we currently rely on traditional methods of radiologists interpreting chest X-rays. This makes detection of pneumonia
challenging as this process can be time-consuming and relies on the expertise of the radiologist making the diagnosis.

#### Goal
We are aiming to tackle this issue by creating quick and accurate methods of detecting pneumonia (bacterial and viral) through the inspection of chest X-rays. Machine learning can aid in the detection of this disease by utilizing Residual Neural Networks (ResNet),
to automate and improve the detection of pneumonia from medical imaging data

#### Dataset
The dataset we will be using is from Kaggle : Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
